# SCL
Salih's C Library (SCL) contains generic containers and procedures to manage it's contents.

***

NOTE: unlike my STL library, this library only takes generic container functionality, hence no seperating folders, etc..
(see https://github.com/daleksla/STL for my C++ library with OOP containers of what's implemented here & more, but also algorithms & other memory management functionalities).
