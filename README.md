# SGL
Salih's Generic Library (SGL) contains generic containers, procedures to manage their contents, & algorithms. 
This library has been primarily developed for the C programming language, however it has been written for CXX compatibility.

***

NOTE: this library contains generic functionality (ie. traffics in void pointers, features require manual type-casts).
(see https://github.com/daleksla/STL for my C++ library with OOP, type-safe containers of what's implemented here with more intuitive interfaces).
